# Password-Generator

## About This Project:
This Python project helps create secure, unique passwords or improve the complexity of existing ones. It's ideal for anyone needing strong protection for their accounts or enhancing the strength of a current key.

## Features:
* __Password Generator__: Create random, secure combinations of varying lengths (8 to 16 characters).
* __Password Strengthener__: Extend an existing key to a desired length with additional secure characters.

## How It Works:
When you run the program, youâ€™ll be prompted to choose one of the following options:

1. __Generate a New Key__:
   * Press `G` to create new keys.
   * Enter the number of keys you'd like to generate.
   * The program will display the requested number of randomly generated secure combinations (each between 8 to 16 characters).
2. __Strengthen an Existing Key__:
   * Press `S` to enhance an existing key.
   * Enter your current key.
   * Specify the desired length for the enhanced version.
   * The program will return your original key extended with additional secure characters.

If you enter an invalid option, the program will notify you and terminate.

> [!NOTE]
> All the string data (passwords) are read and displayed in plain text and are only restricted to the scope of the terminal and not saved or stored elsewhere.
